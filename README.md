- 📸 **AI-Powered Verification** - Take photos of eco-actions, GPT-4 Vision validates them
- 🏆 **Points & Rewards** - Earn points for verified sustainable activities
- 🌍 **Impact Tracking** - See your real CO₂ savings in grams
- 🎮 **Leaderboards** - Compete with friends and the community
- 🔥 **Persistent Progress** - All data saved to the cloud

## 🤖 **How AI Verification Works**

1. **User captures photo** of eco-friendly action
2. **Image converted to base64** for API transmission
3. **Sent to GPT-4 Vision API** with specialized prompt
4. **AI analyzes** and returns JSON:
   ```json
   {
     "isEcoFriendly": true,
     "actionType": "bottle",
     "confidence": 85,
     "reasoning": "Shows a reusable water bottle being refilled",
     "estimatedCO2Saved": 75,
     "impactDescription": "Equal to 0.4km not driven by car"
   }
   ```
5. **Verification logic**:
   - ✅ High confidence (60%+) → Auto-approve
   - ⚠️ Low confidence (<60%) → Ask user confirmation
   - ❌ Not eco-friendly → Reject with explanation
6. **Points awarded** and data saved to Firestore

**Cost**: ~$0.001 per verification using `gpt-4o-mini` model
